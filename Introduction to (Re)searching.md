To summarize the process of Researching:
You have a question and search for an answer. You then query each answser until we have a full understanding of the topic. 
Start with a question, get an anwser and more understanding about it and search for more advanced aspects as needed.

## Vulnerability Searching
When looking for specific exploits you can search for them on websites like:
- [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/): often contains ecploits to download and use
- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search): keeps track of *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)*; CVEs take the form CVE-YEAR-ID
- [CVE Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/)

Kali Linux has "searchsploit", a tool to search in a downloaded version of ExploitDB, preinstalled.

## Manual Pages
On [[Linux Fundamentals|Linux]]  you can use  `man commandName` to display the manual pages of a command.
